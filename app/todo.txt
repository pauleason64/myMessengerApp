//for deployment we want users to use their own firebase settings

Now the application will:

Check for Firebase configuration on first run
If not configured, show the FirebaseConfigActivity
Save configuration in SharedPreferences
Use user-specific Firebase configuration for all Firebase operations
To deploy:

Remove any hardcoded Firebase configuration
Users will need to:
Create their own Firebase project
Get configuration values from Firebase Console
Enter these values in the configuration screen on first run
The configuration will be stored locally on the device and persist between app restarts. Users can also clear and reconfigure if needed.

Would you like me to:

Create the layout for FirebaseConfigActivity?
Add any additional validation or error handling?
Implement a configuration reset option?
Add any other features to make the configuration process easier for users?
