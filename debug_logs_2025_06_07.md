# Debug Log - June 7, 2025

## Current Issue
- User reports that `checkEmailInAuthAndDatabase` is not being called when trying to send a message to `pauleason64@outlook.com`
- The email exists in both Firebase Auth and the Realtime Database with the exact same casing
- Previous attempts to fix case sensitivity were not the solution

## Investigation So Far

### 1. Initial Problem
- User trying to send a message to `pauleason64@outlook.com`
- Logs show the user lookup fails, but the email exists in both Auth and Database
- `checkEmailInAuthAndDatabase` is not being called

### 2. Code Flow Analysis
- The flow should be:
  1. `ComposeMessageActivity.sendMessage()` is called
  2. It calls `contactsManager.fetchAndCreateContact(recipientEmail, callback)`
  3. `fetchAndCreateContact` should call `checkEmailInAuthAndDatabase` if the input is an email

### 3. Potential Issues Identified
- The input might be matching the UID pattern check in `fetchAndCreateContact`
- There might be an existing contact in the cache
- The UID lookup might be failing silently

### 4. Next Steps
1. Add detailed logging to `fetchAndCreateContact` to track the exact flow
2. Check if the input is being treated as a UID or email
3. Verify if the cache check is causing early returns
4. Add error handling for the UID lookup path

## Code Changes Made

### Added to `fetchAndCreateContact` in `ContactsManager.java`
```java
Log.d(TAG, "Starting fetchAndCreateContact for: " + userIdOrEmail);
// ... existing code ...
Log.d(TAG, "1. Looking up user by ID or email: " + userIdOrEmail);

// First check if contact already exists in cache by ID
Contact existingContact = getContactById(userIdOrEmail);
if (existingContact != null) {
    Log.d(TAG, "2. Found existing contact in cache by ID: " + existingContact.getContactId());
    callback.onContactAdded(existingContact);
    return;
}

// If the input looks like a UID (alphanumeric and at least 20 chars)
if (userIdOrEmail.matches("^[a-zA-Z0-9]{20,}$")) {
    Log.d(TAG, "3. Input matches UID pattern, checking users node");
    // ... rest of the UID lookup code ...
}
```

## Next Debugging Steps
1. Check the log output after adding the detailed logging
2. Look for the log messages to see where the flow is breaking
3. Focus on why `checkEmailInAuthAndDatabase` is not being called
4. Check if the input is being incorrectly identified as a UID

## Open Questions
1. What does the log show when trying to send a message?
2. Is the input being treated as a UID or email?
3. Is there an existing contact in the cache that's causing an early return?
